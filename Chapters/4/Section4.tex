  1. let $f(x), g(x) \in \mathbf{Z}[x],$ and suppose that $g(x)$ is monic. Show that there exist unique polynomials $q(x), r(x) \in \mathbf{Z}[x]$ with $f(x)=q(x) g(x)+r(x),$ where either $\operatorname{deg}(r(x))<\operatorname{deg}(g(x))$ or $r(x)=0$

  6. Use Eisenstein's criterion to show that each of these polynomials is irreducible over the field of rational numbers. (You may need to make a substitution.)
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item{$\left.x^{4}+1 \quad \text { (substitute } x+1\right)$}
\item{$x^{6}+x^{3}+1 \quad$ (substitute $x+1$ )}
\item{$ x^{3}+3 x^{2}+5 x+5$}
\item{$x^{3}-3 x^{2}+9 x-10$}
\end{enumerate}

  8. Let $f(x)=x^{2}+100 x+n$
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item{Give an infinite set of integers $n$ such that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbf{Q}$}
