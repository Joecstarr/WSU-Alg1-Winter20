Hint: Find a generator $[a]_{10}$ of $\mathbf{Z}_{10}^{\mathrm{x}}$ and define $\phi: \mathbf{Z}_{4} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_{10}^{\times}$ by $\phi\left([n]_{4}\right)=[a]_{10}^{n}$

We begin by considering $\mathbf{\Z}_{10}^{\times}=\lrs{1, 3, 7, 9}$, observe
$3=3,\ 3^2=9,\ 3^3=7,\ 3^4=1$ showing $\mathbf{Z}_{10}^{\times}=\lra{3}$. We
can then let $\varphi:\Z_4\to \Z_{10}^\times$ be $\pof{n}=3^n$ we can construct
$\pofinv{3^n}=n$ and observe $\pof{\pofinv{3^n}}=\pof{n}=3^n$ showing
$\varphi$ a bijection. We will now show $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.
Let $n,k\in \Z_4$, and $\pof{n+k}=3^{n+k}=3^{n}3^{n}=\pof{n}\pof{k}$, showing
$\varphi$ an isomorphism.

  We first consider $2^{1}=2,\ 2^{2}=4,\ 2^{3}=3,\ 2^{4}=1$ showing $\lra{2}$ is of
  order $4$. We can then observe the order of the elements of 
  $\mathbf{Z}_{8}^{\times}$, $3^2=1,\ 5^2=1,\ 7^2=1$ since none of the elements 
  of $\mathbf{Z}_{8}^{\times}$ have order $4$ it cant me that 
  $\mathbf{Z}_{8}^{\times}$ and $\mathbf{Z}_{5}^{\times}$ are isomorphic.

as a homomorphism, let $\lrp{a,b},\lrp{x,y}\in G_{2} \times G_{1}$
consider

  $\varphi:(G, \cdot)\to(G, *) $, with $\pof{a}=a$ the trivial map is a bijection.

\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
Let $G$ be a group of three elements. Since $G$ is a group there exists an 
identity element $e$ in $G$. This makes $a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b \neq e$ and WOLG
we are left with two options either $aa=e$ or $ab=e$. If $aa=e$ we get the table
$$\vbox{\tabskip0.5em\offinterlineskip

observe $a\cdot\lrp{b\cdot b}=a$ but $\lrp{a\cdot b}\cdot b=e$ showing this is 
not a group under $\cdot$.

isomorphic to $\Z_3$
