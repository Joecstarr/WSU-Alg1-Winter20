  1. Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $D$ be an integral domain. Let $\phi: R \rightarrow D$ be a nonzero function such that $\phi(a+b)=\phi(a)+\phi(b)$ and $\phi(a b)=\phi(a) \phi(b),$ for
all $a, b \in R .$ Show that $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism.

  4. Show that taking complex conjugates defines an automorphism of $\mathbf{C .}$ That is, for $z \in \mathbf{C},$ define $\phi(z)=\bar{z},$ and show that $\phi$ is an automorphism of $\mathbf{C}$

  9. Define $\phi: \mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{2}] \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ by $\phi(m+n \sqrt{2})=m-n \sqrt{2},$ for all $m, n \in \mathbf{Z} .$ Show
that $\phi$ is an automorphism of $\mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$
