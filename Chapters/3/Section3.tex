  1. $\dagger$ Find $H K$ in $\mathbf{Z}_{16}^{\times}$, if $H=\langle[3]\rangle$ and $K=\langle[5]\rangle$
\end{mdframed}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
  We begin by calculating $H=\lrs{1,\ 3,\ 9,\ 11}$ and $K=\lrs{1,\ 5,\ 9,\ 13}$. 
  now by observing $(3\cdot13)\%16=7$ and $(3\cdot5)\%16=15$ we get $\Z_{16}^\times$.

  3.  Find an example of two subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $S_{3}$ for which $H K$ is not a subgroup.

\end{mdframed}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
  Let $H=\lrs{\lrp{\ },\ \lrp{1,2}}$ and 
  $K=\lrs{\lrp{\ },\ \lrp{1,2,3},\ \lrp{1,3,2}}$ we then
  take \\
  $HK= \lrs{\lrp{\ },\ \lrp{1,2},\ \lrp{2,3},\ 
            \lrp{1,3},\ \lrp{1,2,3},\ \lrp{1,3,2}}$
  we observe this isn't a proper subgroup of $S_3$.
