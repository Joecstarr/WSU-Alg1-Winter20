%13. # Show that in a finite cyclic group of order $n$, the equation $x^{m}=e$ has exactly $m$ solutions, for each positive integer $m$ that is a divisor of $n$
%15. Prove that any finite cyclic group with more than two elements has an even number of distinct generators.
%17. thet $G$ be a finite group, and suppose that for any two subgroups $H$ and $K$ either $H \subseteq K$ or $K \subseteq H .$ Prove that $G$ is cyclic of prime power order.
%18. Let $G$ be the set of all 3 $\times 3$ matrices of the form $\left[\begin{array}{lll}1 & 0 & 0 \\ a & 1 & 0 \\ b & c & 1\end{array}\right]$
%(a) Show that if $a, b, c \in \mathbf{Z}_{3},$ then $G$ is a group with exponent 3
%(b) Show that if $a, b, c \in \mathbf{Z}_{2},$ then $G$ is a group with exponent 4.
%19. Prove that $\sum_{d | n} \varphi(d)=n$ for any positive integer $n$ Hint: Interpret the equation in the cyclic group $\mathbf{Z}_{n},$ by considering all of its sub-
%groups.
%20. Let $n=2^{k}$ for $k>2 .$ Prove that $\mathbf{Z}_{n}^{\times}$ is not cyclic. Hint: Show that \pm 1 and $(n / 2) \pm 1$ satisfy the equation $x^{2}=1,$ and that this is impossible in any cyclic group.
%21. # Prove that if $p$ and $q$ are different odd primes, then $\mathbf{Z}_{p q}^{\times}$ is not a cyclic group.
%22. Let $G$ be a group with $p^{k}$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number and $k \geq 1 .$ Prove that $G$ has a subgroup of order $p$
