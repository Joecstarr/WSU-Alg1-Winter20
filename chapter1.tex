1.    Let $m,n.r.s\in \Z$. If $m^2+n^2=r^2+s^2=mr+ns$, prove that $m=r$ and 
$n=s$.
\end{mdframed}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
We select $m,n.r.s\in \Z$, given $m^2+n^2=r^2+s^2=mr+ns$ which can write
as $m^2+n^2-mr-ns=r^2+s^2-mr-ns$. From here we can simplify:
\begin{align*}
m^2+n^2-mr-ns=r^2+s^2-mr-ns &\Rightarrow 
m\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}=r\lrp{r-m}+s\lrp{s-n} \\
&\Rightarrow m\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}-r\lrp{r-m}-s\lrp{s-n}=0 \\
&\Rightarrow m\lrp{m-r}+r\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}+s\lrp{n-s}=0 \\
&\Rightarrow \lrp{m-r}\lrp{m+r}+\lrp{n-s}\lrp{n+s}=0 \\
\end{align*}
from here we can see that in order for $\lrp{m-r}\lrp{m+r}+\lrp{n-s}\lrp{n+s}=0$
to be true $m=r$ and $n=s$.

Select $a,b,c\in \Z$ to satisfy $a+b+c=0$, WLOG let $n\in \Z$ such that 
$n\vert a$ and $n\vert b$. Since $\lrp{a+b}+c=0$ it must be that $\lrp{a+b}=-c$.
From here we must show $n\vert\lrp{a+b}$, or $a+b=nq$. Since $n\vert a$ and 
$n\vert b$ we may write $a=nq_1$ and $b=nq_2$, yielding, 
$nq_1+nq_2=n\lrp{q_1+q_2}=nq$ thus $n\vert c$, as desired.$\square$

The conjecture is that the statement is true for even values of $n$.

    \lrp{2k}+2&=\lrp{2k}1+\lrp{2}\\

\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]

We begin by writing $k=a^2-b^2$, since $a$ and $b$ are odd we can write, 
\begin{align*}
    a&=2r+1\\
    b&=2s+1
\end{align*} 
from here we have $q^2-b^2=4\lrp{r+s+1}\lrp{r-s}$. Since $k>0$ we must consider 
two cases $r-s=2m+1$ and $r-s=2m$. 
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item [$r-s=2m$:]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
        In this case we have $q^2-b^2=4\lrp{r+s+1}2m=8\lrp{r+s+1}m$ and we are 
        done. 
    }
    \item [$r-s=2m+1$:]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
        In this case we have $r-s=2m+1$ and $r+s=r-s+2s=2m+1+2s$
        \begin{align*}
            q^2-b^2&=4\lrp{r+s+1}\lrp{2m+1}\\

11. Prove that $n^4+4^n$ is composite if $n>1$.
\end{mdframed}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
We are presented with two potability's, $n$ is even or $n$ is odd.
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item [$n$ even]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
        It's obvious that $n^4+4^n$ is an even not $2$ and can't be prime. 
    }
    \item [$n$ odd]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
    We begin by completing the square 
    \begin{align*}
        n^4+4^n&= n^4+4^n\\
        &=\lrp{n^2}^2+\lrp{2^n}^2\\
        &=\lrp{n^2+2^n}^2-2n^2 2^n
    \end{align*}
    We from here we observe that $2^n2=2^{n+1}$, since $n$ is odd $n+1$ is even 
    yielding $2^{n+1}=2^{2k}$. We can see we have a difference of squares
    \begin{align*}
        \lrp{n^2+2^n}^2-2n^2 2^n&=\lrp{n^2+2^n}^2-\lrp{2^nn}^2\\
        &=\lrp{n^2+2^n+2^nn}\lrp{n^2+2^n-2^nn}
    \end{align*}
    since we are restricted to $n>1$ we can see that both $\lrp{n^2+2^n+2^nn}>1$
    and $\lrp{n^2+2^n-2^nn}>1$ for all $n$. Making $n^4+4^n$ composite as 
    desired.

    Let $x\in \lrp{a\Z \cap b\Z}$, since $x\in a\Z$ we have $x=aq_1$, similarly 
    since $x\in b\Z$ we have$x=bq_2$. We can see that $x=abq$, this means $x$ 
    is a multiple of $\lrb{a,b}$ putting $x\in \lrb{a,b}$. Next, we let 
    $x\in \lrb{a,b}\Z$, this means $x$ is of the form $x=\lrb{a,b}q$. We can see
    that $a\vert x$ and $b\vert x$ since $a\vert \lrb{a,b}$, This makes 
    $x\in a\Z$ and $x\in b\Z$, as desired.
