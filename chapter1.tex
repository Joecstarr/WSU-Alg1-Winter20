  1.    Let $m,n.r.s\in \Z$. If $m^2+n^2=r^2+s^2=mr+ns$, prove that $m=r$ and
  $n=s$.
\end{mdframed}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
  We select $m,n.r.s\in \Z$, given $m^2+n^2=r^2+s^2=mr+ns$ which can write
  as $m^2+n^2-mr-ns=r^2+s^2-mr-ns$. From here we can simplify:
  \begin{align*}
    m^2+n^2-mr-ns=r^2+s^2-mr-ns & \Rightarrow
    m\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}=r\lrp{r-m}+s\lrp{s-n}                                             \\
                                & \Rightarrow m\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}-r\lrp{r-m}-s\lrp{s-n}=0 \\
                                & \Rightarrow m\lrp{m-r}+r\lrp{m-r}+n\lrp{n-s}+s\lrp{n-s}=0 \\
                                & \Rightarrow \lrp{m-r}\lrp{m+r}+\lrp{n-s}\lrp{n+s}=0       \\
  \end{align*}
  from here we can see that in order for $\lrp{m-r}\lrp{m+r}+\lrp{n-s}\lrp{n+s}=0$
  to be true $m=r$ and $n=s$.

  Select $a,b,c\in \Z$ to satisfy $a+b+c=0$, WLOG let $n\in \Z$ such that

  From here we must show $n\vert\lrp{a+b}$, or $a+b=nq$. Since $n\vert a$ and
  $n\vert b$ we may write $a=nq_1$ and $b=nq_2$, yielding,
  $nq_1+nq_2=n\lrp{q_1+q_2}=nq$ thus $n\vert c$, as desired.$\square$

  from here we have $q^2-b^2=4\lrp{r+s+1}\lrp{r-s}$. Since $k>0$ we must consider
  two cases $r-s=2m+1$ and $r-s=2m$.
  \begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item [$r-s=2m$:]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
          In this case we have $q^2-b^2=4\lrp{r+s+1}2m=8\lrp{r+s+1}m$ and we are

\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
  We are presented with two potability's, $n$ is even or $n$ is odd.
  \begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item [$n$ even]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
          It's obvious that $n^4+4^n$ is an even not $2$ and can't be prime.
          }
    \item [$n$ odd]{\hspace{.5in}\newline
          We begin by completing the square
          \begin{align*}
            n^4+4^n & = n^4+4^n                 \\
                    & =\lrp{n^2}^2+\lrp{2^n}^2  \\
                    & =\lrp{n^2+2^n}^2-2n^2 2^n
          \end{align*}
          We from here we observe that $2^n2=2^{n+1}$, since $n$ is odd $n+1$ is even
          yielding $2^{n+1}=2^{2k}$. We can see we have a difference of squares
          \begin{align*}
            \lrp{n^2+2^n}^2-2n^2 2^n & =\lrp{n^2+2^n}^2-\lrp{2^nn}^2         \\
                                     & =\lrp{n^2+2^n+2^nn}\lrp{n^2+2^n-2^nn}
          \end{align*}
          since we are restricted to $n>1$ we can see that both $\lrp{n^2+2^n+2^nn}>1$
          and $\lrp{n^2+2^n-2^nn}>1$ for all $n$. Making $n^4+4^n$ composite as

\begin{mdframed}[style=darkAnswer,frametitle={Joe Starr}]
  We begin by letting selecting $p$ a prime and $q$ a prime such that $q=p+2$.
  Now we consider $pq$,
  \begin{align*}
    pq & \rightarrow p\lrp{p+2} \\
       & \rightarrow p^2+p2     \\
  \end{align*}
  We now consider $p+1$, if we take $\lrp{p+1}^2$, we get $p^2+2p+1$. It's
  obvious that $pq+1=p^2+p2+1=\lrp{p+1}^2$, so $pq+1$ is a square when $p$ and $q$ are
  twin primes.
  We can now consider $p$ a prime, and $q$ a prime such that $q=p+n$ with
  $n>2$. If we calculate $pq$ we see that,
  \begin{align*}
    pq & \rightarrow p\lrp{p+n} \\
       & \rightarrow p^2+pn     \\
  \end{align*}
  we then have that $pq+1=p^2+pn+1$ with $n>2$, this is not a square, showing
  when $p$ and $q$ aren't twin primes $pq+1$ is not a square.

  $3^{\frac{m}{n}}=2\rightarrow 3^m=2^n $, a contradiction since there is no
  $m$ and $n$ that satisfy this equivalence, making $\log{2}/\log{3}$
  irrational as desired.
